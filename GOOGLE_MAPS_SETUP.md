# Google Maps Setup Guide

## ✅ Current Status: CONFIGURED
Your Google Maps API key is already configured and working!

**API Key**: `[CONFIGURED]` (stored securely in your `.env` file)

## How It Works

### 1. Secure Storage
- ✅ Your API key is stored in the `.env` file (gitignored)
- ✅ The API key is injected into `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` during development
- ✅ The `.env` file is never committed to version control

### 2. Current Configuration
```
.env file:
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

AndroidManifest.xml:
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" />
```

## Testing the Map

1. **Run the app**: `flutter run`
2. **Navigate to**: Admin > Map
3. **Expected result**: You should see a Google Map centered on Reykjavik

## If You Need to Update the API Key

### Option 1: Manual Update
1. Update your `.env` file with the new API key
2. Update `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` with the new key
3. Run: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`

### Option 2: Using the Helper Script
1. Update your `.env` file with the new API key
2. Run: `dart scripts/update_google_maps_key.dart`
3. Run: `flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter run`

## Troubleshooting

### Map Not Showing
- ✅ **API Key**: Your key is configured correctly
- ✅ **Dependencies**: `google_maps_flutter` is installed
- ✅ **Permissions**: Location permissions are set up
- 🔍 **Check**: Make sure you're testing on Admin > Map screen

### Common Issues
1. **"Google Maps Not Available" message**: This means the API key isn't working
   - Check that the key is enabled for "Maps SDK for Android" in Google Cloud Console
   - Verify billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project

2. **Blank map**: This usually means the API key is working but there might be a network issue
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try refreshing the app

## Security Notes
- ✅ Your API key is stored securely in `.env` (gitignored)
- ✅ The key is restricted to your app's package name
- ⚠️ **Remember**: Never commit API keys to version control
- ⚠️ **Production**: Use different keys for development and production
